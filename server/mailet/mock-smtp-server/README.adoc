James Mock SMTP server
====================

This is our custom made Mock SMTP server that we use for some of our tests in James.

== Dockerized Mock SMTP server

Compile and build the docker image with maven:

    $ mvn package jib:dockerBuild

*Note* : You can add the option '-DskipTests' if you want to skip tests

After Jib created the image, you can run it with:

    $ docker run --rm -p 25:25 -p 8000:8000 james/mock-smtp-server

Where ports:

* 25 : SMTP
* 8000 : HTTP interface for setting mock SMTP server behavior
